# Rat Graphing

**Using python, flask, and bokeh to plot neuronal activity from the stimulation of rats' whiskers.**

This project occurred under collaboration with Monash University and John Monash Science School in an attempt to educate students in data science. 
Most projects only result in basic plotting of the data, but this is an attempt to extend my own programming knowledge and data skills, hopefully creating a tool which can be used for real world analysis of neuronal activity.


Right now it only works for very specific data sets involving the neuron firings in rat brains as a result of their whiskers being flicked. However, this tool has a lot of potential to be reconfigured for other projects, and I'm always up for a challenge.

Here is an example of a typical output:

Pictured is a heatmap and scatter plot of neuron activity over time (the horizontal axis), compared with an amplitude on the vertical axis, which represents the strength of the stimulus on the whiskers.

Each layer may be toggled to be looked at individually, and the graph can be zoomed in and manipulated to assist with analysis of certain features.

If you want to have a better look, there's a couple of interactive examples here:

That's all for now. Feel free to experiment with the code, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have about the project.
